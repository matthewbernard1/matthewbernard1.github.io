<p id="p1"> At first, the cave seemed to be empty, with there being no one in sight until Anabelle heard a strange noise coming from the inside of the cave. While she told Lionel and James not to worry, out came serval ghosts from the darkness. The longer the kids stayed in there, the louder the noises became. As a result of these ghost howling, the kids became too afraid and decided to leave the cave before the ghosts could come any closer.
