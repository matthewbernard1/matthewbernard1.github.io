 <p id="p1">Hello everyone! This website was produced to talk about my major, the department I am in, and the school I am a part of
    </p>

<br>


<p id="p2">At the University of Miami, I am currently majoring in Studio Art with a minor in Computer Science. As a result of my major and minor, I am a part of the College of Arts and Sciences and am in the department of Art and Art History. When it comes to the opinion of my major, I would say I am a huge fan of it, and hope to get a job in that area in the near future after I graduate from the Univeristy of Miami
