<p id="p1"> Hi everyone! My name is Matthew Bernard and I am a junior at the University of Miami. In my free time when I’m not going to class, I typically spend the time either running, fishing, or playing the drums. When it comes to music, I am a big fan of rock n roll as well as rap. To name some bands I like, I am a big fan of both Metallica and Great Van Fleet. For me, you truly can’t go wrong with fast pace drums and guitar in any song. When it came to reasoning for why I decided to take this course, it was due to the fact that I am a big fan of web design. While I haven’t designed many websites before, I have always dreamed of working for a big tech company in the future after I graduate college. By taking this course I hope it becomes a key part in helping make that dream come true.
