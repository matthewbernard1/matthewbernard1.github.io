<p id="p1"> After everyone left the cave, the three kids returned home. After returning home, Anabelle was sad, since she felt like she did a bad thing by not listening to her mom and putting herself in danger. After apoligizing to her family, her mom decided to make her tea to warm herself up. After thanking Anabelle for being honest, her mom decided to head back to her room to catch some sleep. Being thankful for her mom caring for her, Anabelle said out loud, "Thank you mom, you are truly the best!" To which her mom replied by saying not to worry. However, despite the fact that Anabelle thought she was now safe, her mom left the room with a strange laugh, revealing herself to be one of the ghosts that ended up following Anabelle home."
